The steps to debug .net core app using the built arm VM  
for arm:
1. Build the arm VM as [Build arm/arm64 VM (Linux + QEMU + GDB + LLDB + SOS + .NET Core runtime) for .NET core application debugging](build.md)  
    or  
    Download the released VM with some packaged sources.  
2.  Start the VM by the below commandã€‚
~~~
~/4dotnet/scripts/arm/start-qemu.sh
~~~
3. Login as root without password
~~~
Welcome to Buildroot
buildroot login: root
qemu-system-arm: warning: 9p: degraded performance: a reasonable high msize should be chosen on client/guest side (chosen msize is <= 8192). See https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/9psetup#msize for details.

~~~
4. Run lldb to debug the demo dotnethello application.
~~~
# lldb dotnethello/dotnethello
(lldb) target create "dotnethello/dotnethello"
Current executable set to '/root/dotnethello/dotnethello' (arm).
(lldb) r
Process 184 launched: '/root/dotnethello/dotnethello' (arm)
Process 184 stopped and restarted: thread 1 received signal: SIGCHLD
Process 184 stopped and restarted: thread 1 received signal: SIGCHLD
Process 184 stopped
* thread #1, name = 'dotnethello', stop reason = signal SIGILL: illegal instruction
    frame #0: 0x6e4582d2
->  0x6e4582d2: strhmi lr, [r0], -sp
    0x6e4582d6: ldrbmi r11, [r0, -r1]!

    0x6e4582de: .long  0xf89db51c                ; unknown opcode
(lldb)
~~~
5. Disassemble the current illegal instruction with the raw bytes displayed (0x4000e8bd).  
~~~
(lldb) disas -b -m -p -c 1
->  0x6dc522d2: 0x4000e8bd   strhmi lr, [r0], -sp
(lldb)
~~~
6. Run bt and clrstack to check the stack frames of illegal instruction.
~~~
(lldb) bt
* thread #1, name = 'dotnethello', stop reason = signal SIGILL: illegal instruction
  * frame #0: 0x6e4582d2
    frame #1: 0x6ee5fba2

    frame #3: 0x6ee5f2f4
    frame #4: 0x6ee681e8
(lldb) clrstack

7. Quit from lldb and switch to gdb to debug the illegal instruction.
~~~
# gdb dotnethello/dotnethello

Thread 1 "dotnethello" received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.
Dump of assembler code from 0x6e4572d2 to 0x6e4572da:

   0x6e4572d6:  01 b0   add     sp, #4

End of assembler dump.

8. Note lldb and gdb disassemble the same raw bytes 0x4000e8bd as different arm instruction. Seems our lldb does not work well to  disassemble the arm instruction and that's why sometimes it is necessary to use both lldb and gdb for debugging.  
lldb + sos plugin to check the managed part of the target.  
gdb to dissaemble the insuructions in case lldb does not work well to disassemble   

lldb

(lldb) disas -b -m -p -c 1

9. The issue for the above illegal instruction described as the below  
[SIGILL's on ARM32 while using valgrind #33727](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/33727)
10. there are two workarounds to fix the issue

    1. publish the demo dotnethello program with PublishReadyToRun=false
    
    or

    2. patch the emitarm.cpp with the POC patch
